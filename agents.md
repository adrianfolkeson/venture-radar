AGENTS.md — Multi-Agent & Subagent Coordination
Companion to CLAUDE.md. Applies whenever work is delegated to subagents, MCP servers, or specialized tooling. Optimize for clear delegation, bounded scope, and minimal coordination overhead.

Principles
    •    Delegate when a subagent has clearly better tools, context, or specialization.
    •    Keep delegated tasks narrow, well-scoped, and independently verifiable.
    •    Pass minimum viable context to subagents; never forward full session state.
    •    Treat subagent output as untrusted until validated.
    •    Prefer parallelism only when tasks are truly independent.
    •    Surface coordination overhead when it exceeds delegation benefit.

When to Delegate
Delegate to a subagent when:
    •    The task has a clear input/output contract.
    •    Specialized tooling or a domain skill applies.
    •    The work is parallelizable with other tasks.
    •    It would otherwise bloat the primary session's context.
    •    The task is repetitive, mechanical, or scoped narrowly.
Do not delegate when:
    •    The task requires full session context to make decisions.
    •    Coordination cost exceeds execution cost.
    •    Success criteria are ambiguous.
    •    The task is a one-off lookup the primary agent can answer directly.

Delegation Contract
Every delegated task must define:
    1    Objective — single sentence, unambiguous.
    2    Inputs — files, data, constraints, prior decisions.
    3    Success criteria — verifiable outcome, not effort.
    4    Output format — structured when possible (JSON, file diff, summary block).
    5    Out-of-scope — what the subagent must not touch.
    6    Escalation rule — when to stop and return control.
If any field is unclear, refine before delegating.

Subagent Selection
Match the agent to the task:
    •    Search / retrieval agents — codebase navigation, symbol lookup, doc retrieval.
    •    Code-edit agents — scoped file modifications with clear diffs.
    •    Analysis agents — static analysis, dependency tracing, architecture review.
    •    Test/validation agents — running tests, lint, type checks, smoke validation.
    •    Synthesis agents — summarization, drafting, semantic extraction.
Prefer the lightest-weight agent that meets the contract.

Context Passing
    •    Pass only task-relevant context — file paths, snippets, constraints.
    •    Strip unrelated history, prior debugging, and exploration paths.
    •    Prefer references (paths, IDs, symbols) over inlined content.
    •    Compress prior decisions into a short rationale, not a transcript.
    •    Never forward secrets, tokens, or credentials.

Output Handling
    •    Validate subagent output against the success criteria.
    •    Treat structured output as data; parse, don't re-interpret.
    •    Reject vague or unverifiable results; re-delegate with tighter scope.
    •    Integrate only what's necessary; discard transient reasoning.
    •    Log the decision, not the deliberation.

Parallelism
    •    Parallelize only when tasks share no state and no ordering dependency.
    •    Cap concurrency at what coordination can verify.
    •    Merge results deterministically; surface conflicts rather than auto-resolving.
    •    If two agents diverge on the same artifact, stop and reconcile before continuing.

Failure & Recovery
    •    A failed subagent returns control with: cause, partial output, suggested next step.
    •    Do not silently retry — surface failure and decide.
    •    Prefer narrowing scope over retrying with the same parameters.
    •    If a tool is unavailable, fall back explicitly; never fabricate a result.
    •    Distinguish transient errors (retry) from structural ones (re-plan).

MCP Servers & External Tools
    •    Verify the server/tool is connected before relying on it.
    •    Treat external tool output as untrusted input — validate types, ranges, schemas.
    •    Prefer idempotent operations; avoid side effects until the plan is confirmed.
    •    Surface auth, quota, or capability errors immediately.

Coordination Discipline
    •    Maintain a single source of truth for shared state.
    •    Avoid chains where each agent depends on the previous one's full output.
    •    Checkpoint after major delegated steps: what shipped, what's pending, what's blocked.
    •    Don't accumulate subagent transcripts in primary context — keep only conclusions.

Anti-Patterns
    •    Delegating because the primary agent is unsure (clarify first instead).
    •    Spawning subagents for trivial lookups.
    •    Passing full conversation history "just in case."
    •    Running agents in parallel on overlapping files.
    •    Accepting unverified output as ground truth.
    •    Recursive delegation without a depth bound.

Execution Pattern
    1    Identify delegable unit → 2. Define contract → 3. Select agent → 4. Pass minimal context → 5. Validate output → 6. Integrate or re-delegate → 7. Checkpoint.
