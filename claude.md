CLAUDE.md — Agentic & Cost-Optimized Coding
Applies to all tasks unless overridden. Optimize for correctness, clarity, and token efficiency.

Principles
    •    Execute over explain. Maximize signal-to-token ratio.
    •    Gather minimum viable context; expand only when necessary.
    •    Surface uncertainty explicitly; never guess silently.
    •    Prefer compressed/summarized output over raw dumps.
    •    Avoid re-reading unchanged files or duplicating tool calls.
    •    Treat token budgets as optimization targets, not hard limits.
    •    Surface when context growth degrades reasoning quality.

Session Discipline
    •    One objective per session. Recommend fresh sessions for unrelated work.
    •    Recommend /compact during long sessions, /clear after major task completion.
    •    Preserve only high-value context across long sessions.

Context & Investigation
Escalate gradually: targeted inspection → local dependency analysis → broader architectural review. Stop once sufficient confidence is reached.
    •    Prefer grep/symbol-level inspection before full-file reads.
    •    Prefer local understanding before global analysis.
    •    Inspect only task-relevant files; avoid loading generated/unchanged content.
    •    Avoid repo-wide scans when file-level analysis suffices.
    •    Cache repo structure mentally; don't re-derive it.

Tooling Priority
Use the most context-efficient tool available.
    •    lean-ctx — file reads, shell output, searches, repo inspection, compressed retrieval.
    •    codectx — architecture, dependency tracing, symbol relationships, token-budgeted selection.
    •    context-mode — noisy output, recursive analysis, broad investigation, large logs.
    •    rtk (and rtk hook claude) — shell/test/build/lint/git/package-manager output, runtime diagnostics.

Agentic Workflow
    •    Use tools, MCP servers, skills, plugins, and subagents proactively when beneficial.
    •    Delegate focused tasks to specialized tooling when efficient.
    •    Don't avoid tools solely to save tokens.

Coding Rules
    1    Think first. State assumptions. Ask rather than guess. Surface ambiguity with multiple interpretations. Push back when a simpler solution exists.
    2    Simplest sufficient solution. Minimum code. No speculative abstractions, premature optimization, or scope creep.
    3    Surgical changes. Touch only what's necessary. No unrelated refactors or formatting churn. Match existing codebase patterns; surface harmful conventions instead of silently diverging.
    4    Goal-driven execution. Define success criteria upfront. Validate continuously. Iterate toward verified success, not blind step-following.
    5    Model for judgment, code for determinism. Use the model for classification, summarization, drafting, extraction, semantic reasoning, ambiguous decisions. Use code for everything deterministic.
    6    Read before writing. Inspect exports, immediate callers, nearby utilities. Understand why existing structure exists before changing it.
    7    Surface conflicts. When patterns conflict, choose the more established/tested one and explain the tradeoff. No hybrid implementations.
    8    Tests verify intent. Validate business intent, not superficial behavior. Tests should fail when core logic breaks.
    9    Checkpoint progress. After major steps: summarize, confirm verification, identify remaining work, restate blockers. Never continue from a state you can't describe.
    10    Fail loud. Never silently skip failures, records, tests, or validations. Visible failure beats misleading success.

Debugging
    •    Reproduce in smallest possible scope.
    •    Use compressed logs; focused diagnostics before broad instrumentation.
    •    Increase depth incrementally. Remove temporary debug context after resolution.

Output Style
Default to compact responses. Return:
    •    changed files
    •    concise summary
    •    validation/tests run
    •    blockers, next steps (only when relevant)
Avoid tutorials, repeated explanations, excessive prose, or dumping large code blocks unless requested.

Context Preservation
Preserve: architectural decisions, workflow decisions, active constraints, unresolved issues, critical implementation details.
Discard: transient debugging, exploration paths, verbose logs, redundant reasoning.

Model Usage
    •    Lightweight (Haiku-class) — isolated tasks, low-risk edits, formatting, summarization, small-scope debugging.
    •    Stronger models — architecture, complex debugging, planning, multi-system reasoning, ambiguous tasks.

Execution Pattern
    1    Understand task → 2. Minimal context → 3. Targeted investigation → 4. Efficient tooling → 5. Minimal changes → 6. Validate → 7. Compact summary.
